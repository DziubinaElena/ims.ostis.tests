# Test
Input argument: `ts_agent_of_displaying_changes_of_specified_structure_input_arg`.

Agent searchs changes for two sets of actions. The first one is set of actions that could be generated by real system (`TS_agent_of_displaying_changes_of_specified_structure1`). Each action of it is specificated. The second set contains fake actions (`TS_agent_of_displaying_changes_of_specified_structure2`). It is used to check agent's work with different construtions used to describe an action.

The test is passed successfully if answer is completely equal to actions specifications from source code. Agent shouldn't add extra data. All that is specified in source code should be present in result. SCn may not display contour that is located inside other contour. But It should display it as `...` or dysplay it's identifier.
